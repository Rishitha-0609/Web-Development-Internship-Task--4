Applied responsive web design using CSS media queries (`max-width: 768px`) to ensure mobile-friendliness:

### Media Query Adjustments:

- About section stacks image and text vertically
- Flex/grid elements wrap naturally for small viewports
- Images and sections scale within containers
- Removed fixed widths where necessary
